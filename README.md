# OrbisRCP

OrbisRCP is the next generation of OrbisGIS components. The components are RCP eclipse based and must be used inside [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

[DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) is a free and opensource multi-platform database tool to query, explore and manage data. Since the 6.2.2 version,the OrbisGIS team collaborates with the DBeaver team to integrate its own components : database, scripting console, map viewer...

Please look at the readme file available in the directory of the plugins you want to install.

If you have any questions, comments or troubles with the plugins, feel free to push an issue. We will do our best to address them.


## Note

Two repositories are available to install the OrbisRCP plugins.

http://devs.orbisgis.org/eclipse-repo  that contains released versions

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adrbessy/orbisrcp/p2-repository/ that contains current snaphot versions (deployed after each PR).
